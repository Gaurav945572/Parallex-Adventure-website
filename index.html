            <h2 class="Secheading">Adventure Time!</h2>
            <p class="text">An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience. It may also be a bold, usually risky
                undertaking, with an uncertain outcome. Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical
                danger such as exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, river rafting, or participating in extreme
                sports. The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical,
                financial, or psychological risk, such as a business venture, or other major life undertakings.
                <br><br>
                A good adventure story has the ability to draw us into a world we might otherwise never explore. We come
                to care about the characters and the things that are important to them. We visit places we would
                normally never choose to go and sometimes glimpse a little spark of adventure inside us we didn't know
                was there.

            <div class="bg bg1" id="biking">
                <h2 class="heading" >BIKING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Biking is an activity that involves a bicycle. You can ride the bike on a road, bike path, a
                mountain trail, or rough terrain. Some use the term “biking” to refer specifically to a mountain biking
                context, and it is often associated with riding a heavy duty bicycle on rougher terrain.
                <br><br>
                Mountain biking usually takes place on mountain trails, dirt roads, or parks. It first originated as a
                sport in California, United States. The first bikers who engaged in the sport used a type of bike called
                cruiser bicycles. This single-speed bicycle comes with balloon tyres and an upright seating posture. It
                has fewer gears, which make it the perfect bike when you want to simply enjoy riding without thinking
                about what gears to control. Nowadays, people who engage in mountain biking and off-the-road biking use
                mountain bikes.

            <div class="bg bg2"  id="para">
                <h2 class="heading heading2">PARA GLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders:
                lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot
                sits in a harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is
                maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the
                aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.
                <br><br>
                Bir is a delightful picturesque small town that is suitable for Paragliding in India because of its
                visual splendour and natural geological formations, such as valleys and lush green slopes! Depending on
                your preferences, you can take a long flight of up to 30 minutes or a shorter journey of roughly 15
                minutes.
                The equipment utilised for this trip in Himachal Pradesh undergoes stringent safety testing, and the
                expedition is led by a team of carefully picked professionals. It's one of the best places in Himachal
                Pradesh to go paragliding from an altitude of 8000 feet. So, if you want to experience the thrill of
                paragliding in a beautiful location like Bir Billing, it will be even more memorable.

            <div class="bg bg3" id="surfing">
                <h2 class="heading" >SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem
                surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually
                carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores,
                but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal
                bore, or in wave pools.
                <br><br>
                The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are
                several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of
                the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on
                their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a
                wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
                Three major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are stand-up paddling, long boarding and short boarding
                with several major differences including the board design and length, the riding style and the kind of
                wave that is ridden.

            </div>
            <p class="text">

                Ziplining is an exhilarating outdoor adventure activity that involves descending from an elevated point
                to another using a cable and a pulley system. Participants typically wear a harness and are attached to
                the cable, allowing them to glide along at high speeds, experiencing the sensation of flying.
                <br><br>This adventure sport has gained popularity worldwide as a thrilling and accessible way for
                people to experience the excitement of soaring through the air. Ziplining courses can vary in length and
                difficulty, offering options for both beginners and experienced thrill-seekers. Safety measures,
                including thorough briefings and the use of quality equipment, are typically in place to ensure a secure
                and enjoyable experience for participants.
                Ziplining is often set in scenic locations such as forests, mountains, or across valleys, providing
                participants with breathtaking views and a unique perspective of the surroundings.

                helmets.

                wildlife, and the thrill of the water adventure.

            <p class="text">

                Bungee jumping is an extreme adventure sport that involves leaping from a high platform, such as a
                bridge or a cliff, while connected to a stretchable cord or bungee cord. The participant experiences a
                free fall until the cord reaches its maximum extension, at which point it recoils, providing a bouncing
                or pendulum-like motion.
                <br><br>Bungee jumping provides an intense adrenaline rush and a sense of exhilaration as individuals
